Contact [mudaliar.aditya@gmail.com](mailto:mudaliar.aditya@gmail.com)

A Basic Chat Application made with CUI client and server,the network is my major concern and priority,only one to one chat is supported but around 30 clients can communicate as udp is being used there is a chance for losses but still each packet which is not yet recieved a response is sent again



Features To be Added

 1. Resending from server[implemented]
 2. Shared memory Latency Tool{Dont think this will ever be implemented}
 3. removing logs{??}
 4. OOPS{not necessary}
 5. Adding event to functions
 6. variable data length{Done}
 7. GUI to client{Pending}
 8. Cross platform client and server{Dont think server will be made cross platform,client code has to be merged}
